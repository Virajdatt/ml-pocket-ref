# ml-pocket-ref

This repo contains my notes and super readable ML code inspired from Matt Harrison's [Machine Learning Pocket Reference](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Pocket-Reference-Structured/dp/1492047546) Book.

## The package-installs.ipynb contains the pip install commands to install various library that the book teaches.

## The Text-Book-Notes.ipynb contains textual notes mostly that I learn through the books literature

## explicit-code-notes.ipynb contanins python code for various tasks that the book teaches, I have tried to group code not based on the chapters in the book but based on the libraries that the book teaches. As I continue learning this structure may change. The end goal of this notebook is to have code-snippets grouped by certain criteria that people can use in their own studies/projects to get to there results rather than focusing too much on the coding . 

## Next-Steps

1. Please implement the imbalance code presented in the book and also explore SMOTE and other algos
